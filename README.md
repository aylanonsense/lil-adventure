# lil-adventure
A lil adventure where you walkabout a tile grid.

## Getting started
Check it out on [Castle](https://castle.games/@bridgs/lil-adventure) to start playing!

## Controls
Use the arrow keys to move. That's it!

## Features
Features this project showcases that you can learn from:

- Tile-based collision detection
- Level data stored as an in-memory string
- Sprites drawn from a uniformly-spaced sprite sheet

## Next steps
Directions you can take this project:

- Try messing with the level data to generate a new level
- Draw and add some more tile types (rivers? bridges? flowers?)
- Transition between screens when the player walks all the way to the left or right
- Add another button that makes the character do something
